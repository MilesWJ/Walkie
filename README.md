# Walkie
A chat bot you can converse with. This program utilizes a response system, meaning all of the responses are chosen at random based on what you say.

# Required Packages
- None, all standared libraries.

# How To Use?
Execute the main.py file and type into the console. It's imperative that you use proper spelling and grammar. The bot may not be able to respond to anything too out of the ordinary. The conversation will go back and forth, you say something, then the bot says something.
